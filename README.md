## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive data management system for smart bracelets. These devices collect various health metrics, which we store, analyze, and visualize. The system includes:

- A database for storing user data and metrics.
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines to process data.
- Tools for data analysis and visualization.

By leveraging modern technologies, this project aims to provide insights into health trends and user behavior.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to achieve its goals. Below is a list of the key technologies:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **Data Science Tools**: Python, ETL pipelines
- **Data Warehousing**: Supabase
- **Management**: Database management techniques

You can find more about these technologies in the relevant documentation or tutorials online.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akshay1010567/tp_final_pulseras_inteligentes.git
   cd tp_final_pulseras_inteligentes
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Install PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
   - Create a new database for the project.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use the following command to install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file to store your database credentials.
   - Ensure your ETL pipeline configurations are correct.

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will start the ETL process, pulling data from the smart bracelets and loading it into your database.

### Accessing the Data

You can access the stored data using SQL queries or through the provided API endpoints. Make sure to refer to the API documentation for detailed instructions.
